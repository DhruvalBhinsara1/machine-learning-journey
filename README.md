# 👋 Hi, I'm Dhruval Bhinsara — Welcome to My Machine Learning Journey!

This repository is my personal tracker, notebook, and portfolio for mastering Data Structures, Algorithms, and Machine Learning. My goal: build solid ML fundamentals, complete Andrew Ng’s specialization, create portfolio projects, and land an ML internship by mid-2026.

## 🚀 My Roadmap & Progress

See [`Roadmap/roadmap.md`](Roadmap/roadmap.md) for my detailed learning path, including:
- **Preparation & Setup:** Bookmarking key resources, setting up Python, VS Code/Jupyter, and learning Git basics.
- **Launch Week:** Starting with Scaler Math for ML, Google ML Crash Course, and 3Blue1Brown’s Linear Algebra series.
- **Main Course:** Enrolling in Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning Specialization, taking notes, and completing assignments.
- **Projects:** Building hands-on projects like Housing Price Prediction and Sentiment Analysis, plus practicing data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Extended Learning:** Advancing to deep learning, building portfolio projects, and applying for internships.
- **Ongoing Habits:** Sharing progress on GitHub/LinkedIn, engaging with ML communities, and reflecting weekly.
